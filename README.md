This Is An Assignment For My Web Development Course, Where I Was Tasked With Creating The Homepage Of A Model-Fashion Website Based On A Given Design Layout (https://www.behance.net/gallery/97376811/Premier) Using HTML And CSS.

Although I Built The Entire Website Myself, I Used AI Tools (Such As ChatGPT & Claude) For Assistance When I Got Stuck. The Areas Worth Mentioning Include:

1)Animating The Floating Images Of Models After The Video (As The <Marquee> Tag Wasnâ€™t Effective).

2)Creating The Circular Text Animation After The VOGUE / SHOT Text.

3)Implementing The Moving Text Animation (Premier Model 2020).

4)Adding Social Media Icons In The Footer.

5)Selecting And Applying The Two Primary Fonts In CSS.
